# Image-Compression-and-Quality-Assessment-Using-Discrete-Cosine-Transform-and-JPEG-Quantization
This study presents an in-depth analysis of image compression using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and JPEG quantization. By applying these techniques to a standard test image, the study evaluates the compression efficiency and assesses the image quality using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR
